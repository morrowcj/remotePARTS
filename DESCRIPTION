Description: 
  These tools were created to test map-scale hypotheses about trends in large 
  remotely sensed data sets but any data with spatial and temporal variation
  can be analyzed. Tests are conducted using the PARTS method for analyzing spatially
  autocorrelated time series 
  (Ives et al., 2021: <doi:10.1016/j.rse.2021.112678>). 
  The method's unique approach can handle extremely large data sets that other 
  spatiotemporal models cannot, while still appropriately accounting for 
  spatial and temporal autocorrelation. This is done by partitioning the data 
  into smaller chunks, analyzing chunks separately and then combining the 
  separate analyses into a single, correlated test of the map-scale hypotheses.
